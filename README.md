# React Sample Project

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite project with routing and state management.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **NPM** (Node Package Manager) - comes bundled with Node.js

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal/command prompt in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### Step 2: Start Development Server

After the installation is complete, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server with hot module replacement (HMR).

### Step 3: Access the Application

Once the development server is running, you should see output similar to:

```
Local:   http://localhost:3000/
Network: use --host to expose
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application.
